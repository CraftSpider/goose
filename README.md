# Goose

An interpreted language that wants to cause problems.

This language has no:
- Conditional statements
- Loop statements

What this language does have:
- Functions that execute until some condition is true

The language syntax and semantics are designed to be annoying, and sometimes difficult, while still being usable.

## Getting Started

See the [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)

## Reference

The behavior of this implementation is considered the normative reference for goose. If the written documentation
and the behavior conflict, the implementation is considered correct unless fixed.
